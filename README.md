# NumberKeyboardLayout
A number keyboard has near full function of System Keyboard. <br />
I only focus to create a number decimal keyboard, But I have implemented some event to get usefully for my keyboard. <br />
I hope you will get more benefit from it, so you can custom a owner keyboard with text only, number un-sign only, phone only, password only ... etc. <br />
